There's something about reading children's books: the art, how deep but easy it is to understand the story, etc. There is so much to experience and learn from these books, both for adults and children. Who says children's books are only for children?!\n\n\n\n![The cover of The Map Into the World and The Most Beautiful Thing by Kao Kalia Yang](/img/IMG_6284.jpeg \"The Map Into the World and The Most Beautiful Thing\")\n\n\n\n# **A little about the authors of these books:**\n\nLike many others, I read Ibram X Kendi's How To Be an Antiracist book this year and was excited to hear that he was releasing a children's book. I ended buying three copies of it, haha.Â \n\nI discovered Kao Kalia Yang after my brother shared this article. Kao Kalia Yang wrote an article after an interview Radiolab released with her and her uncle, dismissing the Hmong experience on Yellow Rain.\n\nYou can read about it [here](<https://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/2012/10/22/science-racism-radiolabs-treatment-hmong-experience>).\n\n\n\n# What's next?\n\nI bought A Handful of Quiet Happiness in Four Pebbles by Thich Nhat Hanh from [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/books/a-handful-of-quiet-happiness-in-four-pebbles/9781937006211). Looking forward to reading it and getting good meditation activities!\n\nIf you have any great children's books written by BIPOC authors, let me know on Instagram [@arisaknits](https://www.instagram.com/arisaknits/)!",
