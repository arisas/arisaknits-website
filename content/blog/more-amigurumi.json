So, I ended up spending a couple more hours working on a whale amigurumi and sewing in my own eyes, hehe.\n\nIt's really nice to finish a project within a couple hours and to use my leftover yarn stash that just keeps on growing! Also, not having to worry about gauging it! \n\nThe whale isn't my best work, but still cute! The pattern is free BTW.\n\nPattern: [Cube Ocean Friends: Whale, Dolphin and Shark](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cube-ocean-friends-whale-dolphin-and-shark) by [@craftybunnybun](https://www.instagram.com/craftybunnybun/)\n\n\n\n![Blue and white crocheted amigurumi whale](/img/img_6783.jpeg \"Cubed Amigurumi Whale Front View\")\n\n![side view of blue and white crocheted amigurumi whale](/img/img_6784.jpeg \"Cubed Amigurumi Whale Side View\")\n\n\n\nI didn't love sewing all the parts to the amigurumi fox. It was a bit hard to make it look good, so the fox isn't as cute as the pattern photo...\n\n![red, white, and black amigurumi fox](/img/img_6815.jpeg \"Amigurumi Fox\")"
